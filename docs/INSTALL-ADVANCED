              INSTALLING ANWIKI: ADVANCED SETUP
 _____________________________________________________________________


Please visit http://www.anwiki.com/releases to get last updated instructions.
If you need help, read http://www.anwiki.com/support


Advanced setup is a bit more complicated than basic setup, but it worth effort for:
 1) better security level on a standalone setup
 2) running multiple instances of Anwiki on the same server, sharing common Anwiki source code
   (less disk space used, and probably better performances)
 3) using an alternate server for static files (images, javascript, css...)



 (1) Standalone setup (just one instance of Anwiki)
----------------------------------

This kind of install moves all Anwiki files outside webserver's "DocumentRoot" directory.
Then, only the main script and all static files are duplicated to the DocumentRoot directory.
That way, none of potentially harmful file (configuration files, application logs and cache, php classes) can be directly accessed from the web.


1.1 Create a directory somewhere OUTSIDE the DocumentRoot, for installing Anwiki. Let's say "/home/anw/anwiki-src" for example.
    *** This is your unique "root setup" directory. ***

1.2 Edit _anwiki-override-DISABLED.inc.php like this:
<?php
    define('ANWPATH_ROOT_SETUP', '/home/anw/anwiki-src'); //edit this line with your own "root setup" directory
    define('ANWPATH_ROOT_SHARED', ANWPATH_ROOT_SETUP); //no need to change this line
    require_once(ANWPATH_ROOT_SHARED.ANWFILE_INC);
?>

1.3 Rename _anwiki-override-DISABLED.inc.php to _anwiki-override.inc.php

1.4 Upload the following files to your "root setup" directory:
    ./_addons/
    ./_addons-static/
    ./_override/
    ./_override-static/
    ./_writable/
    
    Also upload the following files, as we are in standalone setup:
    ./default/
    ./default-static/
    ./sources/
    ./anwiki.inc.php

1.5 Create a directory somewhere INSIDE the DocumentRoot of your webserver. Let's say "/var/www/anwiki" for example.
    *** This is your unique static location for both default and override files ***

1.6 If you want to use an alternate server for static files, you can skip this step.
    Otherwise, *copy* the following files and directories to your unique static location:
    ./_addons-static/
    ./_override-static/
    
    Also copy the following directory, as we are in standalone setup:
    ./default-static/

    Note: these files must be copied, not moved. They are still needed in your unique "root setup" directory.
          You can also use a symlink from the "root setup" static sub-folders to the unique static location.
    
1.7 Upload the following non-static files which must be accessible from the web server, to your unique static location:
    ./_anwiki-override.inc.php
    ./.htaccess-default
    ./engine.inc.php
    ./index.php

 2. Follow instructions from "basic setup" in file "INSTALL", starting to step 2.

 3. If you want to use an alternate server for static files, read instructions below.




 (2) Multiple Anwiki instances on the same host
----------------------------------

This kind of install shares common source code between multiple instances of Anwiki.
Thanks to Anwiki architecture, you can host dozens Anwiki instances, saving disk space and upgrading easily.




1.1 Create a common directory somewhere OUTSIDE the DocumentRoot, for sharing Anwiki common source code between instances.
    Let's say "/home/anwiki/anwiki-common-src" for example.
    *** This is the "root shared" directory. ***

1.2 Upload the following shared source files to your "root shared" directory:
    ./default/
    ./default-static/
    ./sources/
    ./anwiki.inc.php
    
    Note: these files should never be modified, for doing upgrade easier.
    Remember you can override or extend all default components, 
    and create your own drivers, actions, contentclasses and plugins - which are not stored in this directory.

1.3 Create a directory somewhere INSIDE the DocumentRoot of your webserver, for sharing Anwiki static files between instances.
    Let's say "/var/www/anwiki-default" for example.
    *** This is your default static location ***

1.4 If you want to use an alternate server for static files, you can skip this step.
    Otherwise, *copy* the following directory to your default static location:
    ./default-static/
    
    Note: these files must be copied, not moved. They are still needed in the "root shared" directory.
    You can also use a symlink from the "root shared" static sub-folders to the default static location.

1.5 For each Anwiki instances to host, follow these steps:

    a) Create a directory somewhere OUTSIDE the DocumentRoot, dedicated to your new Anwiki instance.
       Let's say "/home/anwiki/anwiki-instance-1" for example.
       *** This is the "root setup" directory. ***

    b) Edit _anwiki-override-DISABLED.inc.php like this:
<?php
    define('ANWPATH_ROOT_SETUP', '/home/anwiki/anwiki-instance-1'); //edit this line with your own "root setup" directory
    define('ANWPATH_ROOT_SHARED', '/home/anwiki/anwiki-common-src'); //edit this line with your own "root shared" directory
    require_once(ANWPATH_ROOT_SHARED.ANWFILE_INC);
?>

    c) Rename _anwiki-override-DISABLED.inc.php to _anwiki-override.inc.php
    
    d) Upload the following files to your "root setup" directory:
       ./_addons/
       ./_addons-static/
       ./_override/
       ./_override-static/
       ./_writable/
    
    e) Create a directory somewhere INSIDE the DocumentRoot of your webserver, for instance's static files.
       Let's say "/var/www/anwiki-instance-1" for example.
       *** This is your instance static location ***
    
    f) If you want to use an alternate server for static files, you can skip this step.
       Otherwise, *copy* the following files and directories to your instance static location:
       ./_addons-static/
       ./_override-static/
    
    Note: these files must be copied, not moved. They are still needed in the "root setup" directory.
    You can also use a symlink from the "root setup" static sub-folders to the instance static location.
    
    g) Upload the following non-static files which must be accessible from the web server, to your instance static location:
       ./_anwiki-override.inc.php
       ./.htaccess-default
       ./index.php

 2. Follow instructions from "basic setup" in file "INSTALL", starting to step 2.

 3. If you want to use an alternate server for static files, read instructions below.
    



 (3) Optional: alternate server for static files
------------------------------------------------

Using an alternate mirror for serving static files may help to reduce your main server load, if you are getting a lot of traffic.
This also speeds up users navigation, avoiding them to download again the same file, when visiting multiple Anwiki instances.
Static files addressing is a native feature of Anwiki.


1. Follow install steps described above

2. Create a directory to the web server which will host default static files. This server doesn't need PHP support.
   Let's say we create the directory "/var/www2/anwiki-static-files-default/" on "static server".
   This directory can be accessed from "http://staticserver/anwiki-static-files-default/".
   *** This URL is your "default static files URL" ***

3. Upload a *copy* of your default static files which are present in your "root shared" directory:
   ./_default-static/

   You can just upload it throught FTP, SCP or use rsync.
   It's very important to synchronize files from the static server with main server's "root shared" directory:
   if a file is present on static server but not in the "root shared" directory, it won't be accessed.

4. Create a directory to the web server which will host setup's static files for this Anwiki instance.
   -> If you have a standalone setup, this will probably be the same static server as for default static files.
   -> If you are running multiple Anwiki instances, you'll need to create a such directory for each anwiki instance, on the static server of your choice.

   Let's say we create the directory "/var/www2/anwiki-static-files-mysetup/" on "server 1".
   This directory can be accessed from "http://staticserver/anwiki-static-files-mysetup/".
   *** This URL is your "setup's static files URL" ***

5. Upload a *copy* of your setup's static files which are present in your "root setup" directory 
   (if you have a standalone setup, this is your "root shared" directory):
   ./_addons-static/
   ./_override-static/

   You can just upload it throught FTP, SCP or use rsync.
   It's very important to synchronize files from the static server with main server's "root shared" directory:
   if a file is present on static server but not in the "root shared" directory, it won't be accessed.

6. Finally, go to general settings edition: http://www.example.com/your-anwiki-directory/?a=editconfig
   Go to: Advanced settings -> Static files access.
   Enable alternate server and type your "default static files URL" and "setup's static files URL".


7. Enjoy!
