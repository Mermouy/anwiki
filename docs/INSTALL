                 INSTALLING ANWIKI: BASIC SETUP
 _____________________________________________________________________


Please visit http://www.anwiki.com/releases to get last updated instructions.
If you need help, read http://www.anwiki.com/support

Basic setup is the easiest and fastest installation mode.
However, you should read "advanced setup" instructions from file "INSTALL-ADVANCED":
 * if you are concerned about security
 * if you want to run mutliple Anwiki instances on the same server
 * if you want to use an alternate server for static files (images, javascript, css...)
 * if you likes to play with "mv" command just for fun

Otherwise, just follow the following steps:

1. Upload all files from "anwiki" folder to your website

2. Give write permissions for the web server to the following files:
   ./_writable/ and all subdirectories/files
   ./_override/*/*.cfg.php
   
   If you don't fix these permissions now, install assistant will notify you.
   Permissions depends on each server setup, but a chmod g+w (and eventually chgrp www-data) should be sufficient.

3. If you plan to use URL rewriting and if your server allows it, rename:
   ./htaccess-DISABLED to ./.htaccess

4. Go to http://www.example.com/your-anwiki-directory/ and follow instructions

5. Delete ./default/actions/action_install/ directory when installation is finished

6. Edit general settings on http://www.example.com/your-anwiki-directory/?a=editconfig
   Friendly URLs can be enabled from: Setup -> Location settings.

7. Enjoy!
